# About Us

### 1. Stephen Provost
Graduating cum laude with a degree in English, Stephen discovered that the world, unfortunantly,
likes English degrees - but only when accompanied with another degree. After working retail
for several years at Best Buy, and more importantly, working on computer repairs for Geek Squad,
Stephen decided it was time to go back to school. He dreams of making video games, but everyone
must learn to walk before they can run. Rather than limiting himself solely to video games,
Stephen sought to learn a bit more about the development of software itself, and thus, enrolled
in University of Northern Colorado, seeking to become a 'Software Engineer.' While still
intending to make games, Stephen's accepted that's likely something he'll need to pursue in his
off-time, and is looking to expand his capabilities anywhere, in any language. He recognizes
that school provides only the barest glimpse into what the world of programming requires.


### 2. Wolf Reach Studios 

A studio for making games, this will be Stephen Provost's passion project. He has begun working
on a game, name not yet determined, which will be a strategy-styled game in the "new" X-Com style
of games. That is, a grid-based system which will have cover for both your and enemy characters,
a magic system that he is wrestling with, and a mythology that will dabble in a variety of real
world mythologies, but also vary greatly. It will require the player to consider what's important:
keeping their characters healthy, or keeping them "human?"
